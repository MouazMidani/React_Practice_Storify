## üîê Authentication Flow

This is how the authentication flow works in **Storify**, from user interaction to fully authenticated state:

1. **User Initiates Login**  
   The user enters their email (and optionally full name for registration). The component calls `createAccount()` and `verifySecret()` functions.

2. **Appwrite Handles Authentication**  
   `verifySecret()` communicates with Appwrite to create a session. Once successful, Appwrite returns session information.

3. **AuthStore Updates**  
   The Zustand `AuthStore` is updated with the session and user information. The store automatically persists the data to platform-specific storage:
   - **Mobile (iOS/Android)**: `SecureStore.setItemAsync()`
   - **Web**: `localStorage.setItem()`

4. **Components React Automatically**  
   Any subscribed React components detect the updated auth state and re-render. Protected routes redirect based on the current status (`authenticated` or `unauthenticated`).

5. **User Redirected**  
   Once authenticated, the app navigates to the main dashboard. Logging out clears the session, store, and local storage.
